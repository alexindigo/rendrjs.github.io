Arguments:

- `summaries` can be generated by the [Fetcher.summarize](#summarize) function.
- `options` *optional* can be used to pass an instance of the [app](/app).
- `callback` callback function, what you want to invoke after the data is retrieved from the store.

This function is used when [attaching the child views](/view#attachChildViews).
