header: hydrate
example: Fetcher.hydrate(summaries, [options], callback)
---

This method is called when attaching views to the DOM, specifically when [attaching the child views](/view#attachChildViews).  `hydrate` loops through each summary to retrieve the data from the corresponding [Model Store](/model-store) or [Collection Store](/collection-store) for each child view, then it invokes the specified callback.

Hydration occurs either when the HTML has been loaded by the server, or when a view is creating an instance of a child view using a template adapter.

Arguments:

- `summaries` can be generated by the [Fetcher.summarize](#summarize) function.
- `options` *optional* can be used to pass an instance of the [app](/app).
- `callback` this function is invoked after the data is retrieved from the store.
