header: meta
example: Collection.meta

The `meta` attribute is a special attribute on a Collection which allows you to store additional information about the Collection instance.  For example, you can save pagination data in `meta`.

The meta information is part of the information that is stored in the object when you call [Collection.toJSON](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-toJSON).
