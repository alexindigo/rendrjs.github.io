# Collection

Collections are ordered sets of models.  As in Backbone, you can use collections to delegate events for a group of models, listen to the addition or removal of models from the set, and sync those sets with a server.  Rendr provides two main additions over Backbone: the [Collection Store](/collection-store) and the ability to sync the collection in the same fashion on client or server.

See [Backbone.Collection](http://backbonejs.org#Collection) for _all_ of the neat functions this object ships with.
