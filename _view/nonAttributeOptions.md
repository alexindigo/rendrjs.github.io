header: nonAttributeOptions
example: View.nonAttributeOptions

These are options for the view that we don't want to create data-attributes for on the HTML element.  By default it's set to `['id', 'className', 'tagName']`, which are all attributes of the element itself.  For more information about those specific elements check out [Backbone's documentation](http://backbonejs.org/#View).
