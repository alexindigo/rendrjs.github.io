header: getChildViewsByName
example: View.getChildViewsByName(name)

This searches the [childViews](#childViews) attribute to return any children views that have a matching name. The function takes a string for the `name`, and returns an array of matches.

Note: these must be the *exact* name of the view, if the view name includes a path or namespace, that must be included.
