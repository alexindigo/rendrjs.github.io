example: ModelStore.clear([modelName], [id])

Removes the model(s) from the [cache](#cache).  If you pass both the `modelName` and the `id` it will clear that model from the store. If you only pass the `modelName` it will clear all of the models of that type in the store. Passing no arguments will clear the entire model store.
